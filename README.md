### Cookbook
This is a project done during **Le Wagon's Bootcamp - batch #609**.

In the Cookbook Project, we created a ruby project that manages recipes.

The project uses the MVC pattern, also used in rails.

The goal of this project is for us students to get familiarized with two important concepts in Software Architecture:  **single responsibility principle**  and  **separation of concerns**.

After unzipping and saving the contents to your desired directory, run `bundle install` in your terminal to install all the gems required for this program. 

From within your directory, run `ruby app.rb` in the terminal. This program will run inside your terminal.
